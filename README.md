<p id="description">The Educational Institute Management System is a web app that can be utilized by students, teachers and administrators as per roles and requirements. The web app features three primary modules:

-   **Learning Management System:**  This module allows students and teachers to interact with each other, find class schedules, access learning resources, discuss on topics, take quizzes, etc.
-   **Placement Management System:**  This module allows the placement coordinators to carry out placement drives, take and track student registrations, get a list of applied students, etc. Students can also update their personal and academic details as well as other details such as their project, work experience, etc. and can dynamically generate a resume as per the institutes established format, and see eligible placement drives and apply to those directly through the system.
-   **Campus-wide Marketplace:**  This module allows all stakeholders to buy and sell items in the campus as well as report and lost and found items.</p>
